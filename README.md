I’m [**Oussama**], an aspiring **Cyber Security Engineer** based in Morocco. 🇲🇦

I don't just use software; I analyze how it works to make it secure. I am passionate about Network Defense, System Hardening, and Ethical Hacking.

My main technical focus is **Network Security**, **Linux Administration**, and **Scripting** (Python/Bash). My favorite tools are **Wireshark**, **Nmap**, **Burp Suite**, and the **Linux Terminal**.

I’m constantly learning and practicing in CTFs. My goal is to master the art of defensive security and penetration testing.
