### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Oussama**, a Cyber Security student from Morocco. 🇲🇦

I'm focusing on the **Blue Team** (Defensive) side of security. I like digging into Linux systems to see how they work and how to lock them down.

**What I'm learning right now:**
* **SOC Tools:** Learning how to analyze logs using **Splunk** and **Wazuh**.
* **Networking:** Using **Wireshark** and **Tcpdump** to understand traffic.
* **Labs:** I just started my journey on **Hack The Box** to get the basics down.

**My Daily Setup:**
I run **Arch Linux** + **Hyprland** on my main machine.
